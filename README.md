# ToDoList

This project idea is not very creative I know but it was never its purpose so i Guess fuck it. The idea here is to give basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript and how to make website. 

## Goal 

The goal as mentioned to get a grasp of how website and web development works and in the future it might be on a blog that stores all of my uninspired and not at all impressive projects and work. Specific features that the website should have arejust a form that user can enter a activity they want / have to do and then remove them as they progress. Other than that it might be an idea to add times by when tasks should be done but that I won't put as mandatory in the scope of this project but rather a nice closer if I ever come that far.
